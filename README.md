## Switch-Fightstick
Proof-of-Concept Fightstick for the Nintendo Switch. Uses the LUFA library and reverse-engineering of the Pokken Tournament Pro Pad for the Wii U to enable custom fightsticks on the Switch System v3.0.0.

This is forked from progmem/Switch-Fightstick so please see there for documentation and rationale.
